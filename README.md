# favorite_books_library

This is an in-progress lightweight website I made to showcase all my favorite books together. Each genre has its own page which is accessible through a corresponding button on the home page. I'm actively working on the design and the style of this project and continuing to push new updates as I make them. I also update the books displayed whenever I have something new to add.

You can view the website like any other local html site: simply download the repository and open home.html to access it.
