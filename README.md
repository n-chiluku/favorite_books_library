# favorite_books_library

This is an in-progress lightweight website I made for fun to showcase all my favorite books together. I read a lot, and I read practically anything and everything. I'm partial to fantasy, but I will enjoy and read from almost every genre. I love sharing recommendations with my friends, so this is an easy way for me to give people recommendations! Each genre has its own page which is accessible through a corresponding button on the home page. I'm actively working on the design and the style of this project and continuing to push new updates as I make them. I also update the books displayed whenever I have something new to add.

You can view the website like any other local html site: simply download the repository and open home.html to access it.


Future developments I plan to make, time permitting, include the following:

1) Add a feature that will provide recommendation based on the books I've included and search criteria provided by the user (for example, a user could ask for fantasy books based on Chinese mythology, and I have plenty of recommendations for that. Or, they could ask for British classics published before Austen's time, which I could also filter to provide.)
2) Potentially connect to my goodreads account to access all book data, or include more books outside of my favorites
3) Standardize image sizes/reconfigure the display to be a little more pleasing on the eyes/experiment with different layouts
4) Add a back button for each page
5) Restructure the flow between pages/home page layout once more features are added
    (tabs between pages)
